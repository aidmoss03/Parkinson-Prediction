# Parkinson-Prediction
A simple project which uses a LightGBM model to differentiate healthy people from people having Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

This project is a very basic example of how to use LightGBM. In this project we use the UCL Parkinsons dataset.

This is a very small dataset so we cannot expect the most accurate predictions. 
However, regardless of the small dataset the model reaches an average precision of around 90%. 
We could improve on this by working on preprocessing the data or by increasing the data size.
